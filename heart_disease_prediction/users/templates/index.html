        <p>This heatmap shows the correlation between different features in the dataset. Darker colors indicate higher correlation.</p>

        <div id="details_correlation_heatmap" style="display: none;">
            <p>Correlation heatmaps are useful for understanding the relationships between multiple variables. 
            In this heatmap, each cell represents the correlation coefficient between two variables, with darker 
            colors indicating stronger correlations. Positive correlations suggest that as one variable increases, 
            the other tends to increase as well, while negative correlations indicate an inverse relationship.</p>
            <p>Understanding these correlations can help in identifying which features are most influential in predicting heart disease. 
            For instance, if cholesterol levels have a high positive correlation with the target variable, it suggests that higher cholesterol 
            levels might be associated with a higher risk of heart disease. This information is crucial for feature selection and engineering in predictive modeling.</p>

                <div id="details_{{ feature }}" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Count plots are useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical data. 
                    They provide a clear view of how many instances of each category are present in the dataset, 
                    which can be helpful in identifying imbalances and understanding the overall composition of the data.</p>
                    <p>For example, in a dataset concerning heart disease, the count plot for gender might show a higher number of male 
                    patients compared to female patients. Such imbalances can influence the outcomes of predictive models and must be considered 
                    during the data preprocessing and analysis stages.</p>

        <div id="details_boxplot_age_vs_target" style="display: none;">
            <p>Boxplots are a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: 
            minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. They are particularly useful for 
            comparing distributions between different groups. In this boxplot, we compare the age distribution between 
            patients with and without heart disease, which helps in identifying any noticeable age-related trends.</p>
            <p>By analyzing this boxplot, we can observe if older or younger populations are more likely to have heart disease. 
            This information can be valuable for healthcare professionals when considering age as a risk factor in their diagnosis and treatment plans. 
            Outliers can also provide insights into unusual cases that may warrant further investigation.</p>

        <div id="details_histplot_cholesterol" style="display: none;">
            <p>Histograms provide a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. 
            They are useful for understanding the frequency distribution of numerical data by 
            showing the number of data points that fall within a range of values (bins). 
            In this histogram, we visualize the cholesterol levels of patients to identify common ranges and outliers.</p>
            <p>High cholesterol is a known risk factor for heart disease, and this histogram helps in assessing the prevalence 
            of high cholesterol levels among the patient population. Identifying the range within which most cholesterol levels fall 
            can help in setting clinical thresholds for further testing and treatment. Moreover, it can highlight extreme values that

            <p>This histogram shows how the maximum heart rate achieved varies among patients. 
            Understanding the distribution of maximum heart rates can help in assessing the overall cardiovascular health 
            of the patients, and in identifying any unusual values that may indicate potential health issues.</p>
            <p>Max heart rate is often used in stress testing to evaluate the heart's response to physical activity. 
            Analyzing this distribution can reveal insights into the fitness levels and cardiovascular performance of the 
            patient population. It can also help in identifying patients who may have abnormal heart rate responses, which could 
            signal underlying heart conditions.</p>

        <div id="details_violinplot_age_by_target" style="display: none;">
            <p>Violin plots combine aspects of boxplots and density plots. They provide a richer understanding of the distribution of the data. 
            In this plot, we compare the age distributions between patients with and without heart disease, 
            highlighting not only the summary statistics but also the density of data points at different age levels.</p>
            <p>By analyzing the shape and spread of the violin plot, we can identify whether certain age groups are more prone to heart disease. 
            The width of the violin plot at any given age indicates the relative density of patients at that age. 
            This helps in recognizing the most common age groups for heart disease and can guide targeted preventive measures and interventions.</p>
